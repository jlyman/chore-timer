A simple static app for displaying a chore countdown timer for my kids. Nothing more, nothing less.

But feel to use it if you feel it would be helpful! More details here: http://www.joshualyman.com/2016/09/using-the-chip-computer-and-react-to-help-kids-get-chores-done

Bootstrapped with react-create-app. Typical RCA instructions available in the RCA-README.md file.
